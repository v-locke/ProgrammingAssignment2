## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## The answer is that the MakeCacheMatrix function will create a special "matrix" object
## that is able to cache its inverse (or reverse). 


## Write a short comment describing this function
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}

## The answer is that CacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" that is
## created by makeCacheMatrix. The cacheSolve function should get the
## inverse from the cache as long as the inverse was computed.
